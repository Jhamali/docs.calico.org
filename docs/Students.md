## Tips

* Consult the mentor of the project you wish to work on. They will be immensely helpful in findng the right resources to get a head start.

* Do not let your lack of experience, in the specific languages or frameworks, required for the projects hinder you from applying for Calico. With assistance from the mentor, these are fairly easy hurdles to get past. 

* Make use of your mentors. They're there to assist and supervise. Let them know of any issues that come up and don't try to solve everything yourself. You'll have more time to finish your project that way.

* Keeping the previous tip in mind, the mentor can assist you, but it is not their role to teach.

* If an issue feels insurmountable, just keep going, it'll get resolved eventually, and remember, talk to your mentor.
